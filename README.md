# portfolio-website

## This is the journey of creating my own portfolio website.

Alors, building your own portfolio is important for career development.
For a Software Engineer / Developer / Data Scientist,
a 1-page Curriculum Vitae is not enough to showcase skills.

So, what is enough?<br>
**Projects!**

My Portfolio website was designed to consist of 5 sections:
1.  *Home*
2.  *About*
3.  *Projects*
4.  *Blogs*
5.  *Contact*

The contect is of course on-going, but overall this repo is going to give a nice basis of where to put my work from now on.

This has been my first experience with front-end development (HTML, CSS (SASS), Javascript)
